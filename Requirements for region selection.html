<p>The region you select must meet some requirements to make sure that (most of the) assignments can successfully be done for your region of choice.&nbsp;</p>

<td style="height: 16px; width: 36.3101%;">minimum of two stations in your region. Minimum of one year of data, which should overlap the rainfall and evaporation data above. This could be an upstream station where discharge enters your region and a downstream station where it exits your region, or it could be two stations inside your region</td>
<td style="height: 16px; width: 35.9951%;">check the GRDC and USGS databases with available station data. Both of these sources we can make available through the eWaterCycle platform (more info later). Other sources of discharge data are also ok!</td>

<td style="height: 16px; width: 29.8507%;">Open water body</td>
<td style="height: 16px; width: 36.3101%;">your region must have at least one open water body that is visible from space&nbsp;</td>
<td style="height: 16px; width: 35.9951%;">Check google maps for a quick scan. A significant river, lake, reservoir, etc would all do</td>

<td style="height: 16px; width: 29.8507%;">At least two significant hydrological processes must be significantly present.</td>
<td style="height: 16px; width: 36.3101%;">for example: snowmelt and evaporation are significantly present in an Alpine valley. A region with "all rainfall is immediately evaporated" (the Sahara) is not ok.</td>

<td style="height: 16px; width: 29.8507%;">The region must have a name</td>
<td style="height: 16px; width: 36.3101%;">This can be a bureaucratic name like a municipality, country, etc. It can be a catchment (usually named after the river). Anything goes as long as it has an official name.&nbsp;</td>
<td style="height: 16px; width: 35.9951%;">Anything bigger than a typical country would be too ambitious from a data point of view...</td>

<p>Once you have settled on a region, you will need to hand in three things:</p>
<ul>
<li>a shape-file with the contour of your chosen region</li>
<li>a image file that shows your region on a map</li>
<li>a justification why you have chosen this region</li>
